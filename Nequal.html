<p></p><ul> <li> <i>Lando Norris</i> recovered from another fluffed start from <strong>pole position</strong> to beat <i>Max Verstappen</i> at the <strong>Dutch Grand Prix</strong>, claiming an overdue <strong>second</strong> F1 victory in the process on Sunday. <br>

    Having lost the lead off the line, <i>Norris</i> patiently waited until Lap 18 to get back in front of the local favourite.
    
    He controlled the race from that point and his winning margin was a comfortable <strong>22 seconds</strong>, a performance capped by setting the <u>fastest lap</u> on the last lap of the race.
    
    The win -- and the bonus point which comes with it -- helped him chip away at <i>Verstappen's</i> healthy championship lead, which is now <strong>70 points</strong> with <u>nine races</u> to spare.
    
    It gave <i>Norris</i> a second win to add to his <u>Miami Grand Prix</u> triumph at the start of May.</li></ul>

    <ul> <li> While a tight championship battle between the two still seems improbable, the sheer scale of <strong>McLaren's</strong> pace advantage will set up a fascinating run-in to the end of the year, especially with a doubleheader of street circuits in <u>Baku</u> and <u>Singapore</u> after next week's <strong>Italian Grand Prix</strong> where <strong>Red Bull</strong> may struggle.
    
    On the flip side, the <u>Constructors' Championship</u> between their two teams continues to look wide open.
    
    With Norris' teammate <i>Oscar Piastri</i> finishing <strong>fourth</strong> and Verstappen's teammate <i>Sergio Perez</i> finishing <strong>sixth</strong>, <strong>McLaren</strong> now trails by just <strong>22 points</strong>. <strong>McLaren's</strong> only regret might be that it did not make a further dent into that tally, with <i>Piastri</i> struggling to match <i>Norris</i> in the other car. </li></ul>

   <ul><li> <i>Charles Leclerc</i> pipped <i>Piastri</i> to the <strong>third</strong> spot on the podium with a stellar race and a flawless strategy from <strong>Ferrari</strong>, a huge boost ahead of its home race at <strong>Monza</strong> on <strong>Sep 1</strong>.
    
    Leclerc's teammate <i>Carlos Sainz</i> was <strong>fifth</strong> ahead of <i>Perez</i>, who had a quiet but unspectacular race for <strong>Red Bull</strong>, his first since <i>Christian Horner</i> ended speculation the team could replace him with another driver.</li></ul>
    
    <ul> <li> <strong>Mercedes</strong> had come into the weekend with <strong>two wins</strong> from the past three races but faded in the race. <i>George Russell</i> never looked like a factor in the podium fight despite starting fourth, finishing <strong>seventh</strong> while <i>Lewis Hamilton</i> <strong>(eighth)</strong> was always up against it after starting out of position following a disappointing qualifying. <i>Pierre Gasly</i> claimed a superb <strong>ninth</strong> for <strong>Alpine</strong> on <strong>Oliver Oakes'</strong> first race as <u>Team Boss</u>, while <i>Fernando Alonso</i> claimed the final point on offer with <strong>tenth</strong> for <strong>Aston Martin</strong>.</li></ul><p></p>
